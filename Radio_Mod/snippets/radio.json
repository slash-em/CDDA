     "My name is Marcus Crump. I know that. It's cold, why is it so cold? Am I hallucinating? Yes, I'm always hallucinating. The world is an illusion. It's the portal storms! A time loop... an endless loop? I have died so many times. How many zombies are Marcus Crump? I should never have come in here. The eye of the portal storm is just this endless horror, isn't it? I live, I create, I die, I return. Don't enter the storms! Can anyone here me? Help me! Oh god... the storm is in motion again. The swirling, I can feel it pulling me apart! I don't want to go back again! Please!"
